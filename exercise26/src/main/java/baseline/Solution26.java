/*
Write a program that will help you determine how many months it will take to pay off a credit card balance.
The program should ask the user to enter
    the balance of a credit card,
    the APR of the card, and
    their monthly payment.
The program should then return the number of months needed (rounded up to the next integer value).

The formula for this is
    n = -(1/30) * log(1 + b/p * (1 - (1 + i)^30)) / log(1 + i)
n is the number of months.
i is the daily rate (APR divided by 365).
b is the balance.
p is the monthly payment.

Constraints:
Prompt for the cardâ€™s APR. Do the division internally.
Prompt for the APR as a percentage, not a decimal.
Use a class called PaymentCalculator with a public method called calculateMonthsUntilPaidOff, which takes no parameters and returns the number of months.
Round fractions of a cent up to the next cent for internal calculations
