/*
Write a program that prompts for response times from a website in milliseconds. It should keep asking for values until the user enters “done.”

The program should print the average time (mean), the minimum time, the maximum time, and the population standard deviation.

Constraints
Create functions called average, max, min, and std, which take in a list of numbers and return the results.
Use loops and arrays to perform the input and mathematical operations.
Be sure to exclude the "done" entry from the inputs.
Be sure to properly ignore any invalid inputs.
Keep the input separate from the processing and the output.
