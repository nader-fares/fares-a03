/*
Create a program that picks a winner for a contest or prize drawing. Prompt for names of contestants until the user leaves the entry blank. Then randomly select a winner.
Constraints
Use a loop to capture user input into an array.
Use a random number generator to pluck a value from the array.
Donâ€™t include a blank entry in the array.
Some languages require that you define the length of the array ahead of time. You may need to find another data structure, like an ArrayList.
